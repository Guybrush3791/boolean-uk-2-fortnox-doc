# REST, OpenAPI Specs, Request & Response payloads
## Lesson
### RESTful APIs
**RESTful APIs** are application programming interfaces that follow the principles of **REST (Representational State Transfer)** architecture, providing a standardized way for different software systems to communicate over the internet.[[1](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/restful-api/)]

![[RESTful APIs| 1400]]

### OpenAPI 
**OpenAPI Specification** (formerly known as Swagger) is a standardized documentation format that describes **RESTful APIs** in a structured, machine-readable way. [[2](https://dev.to/sacode/designing-restful-apis-with-openapi-a-top-down-approach-b33)]
