# Polymorphism & Inheritance

## Lessons
### Inheritance
**Inheritance** is a fundamental object-oriented programming concept that allows a class to acquire properties and behaviors from another class. The class that inherits is called the **child class** or **subclass**, while the class being inherited from is called the **parent class** or **superclass**.

### Polymorphism
**Polymorphism** means "many forms" and allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. It enables a single interface to represent different underlying forms (data types).
