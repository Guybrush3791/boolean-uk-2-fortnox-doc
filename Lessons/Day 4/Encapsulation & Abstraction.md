# Encapsulation & Abstraction
## LC

## Lessons
### Encapsulation
**Encapsulation** is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods that operate on that data within a single unit (class). It's a fundamental Object-Oriented Programming principle that **hides the internal implementation details** and controls access to the data through well-defined methods.

Then for the Afternoon Exercise introduce them to Bob's Bagels (the OOP version) but make clear that they'll be continuing it on Monday and Tuesday so it doesn't need to be completed today:

### Abstraction
**Abstraction** is the process of hiding internal implementation details while showing only the essential functionality to the user. It focuses on **what an object does rather than how it does it**.
